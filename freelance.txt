Do you know that feeling when you're doing exactly what you were put on the earth to do?
The one works like everything inside you is moving together and harmony with the universe.
Get on!
Get on!
Get on!
Get on!
Get on!
Get on!
Get on!
Get on!
Get in formation!
No matter what happens.
Fuck the fuck!
Get so long, Private!
Everything will be okay.
Get on!
Fuck it all, Bobby!
Private!
Sweet fucking baby Jesus!
Yeah.
Me neither.
But, you know, one can hope, right?
It started when I was a kid.
I always needed to help people.
Leave them alone!
But there at least I wanted to.
So I did what any noble red-blooded American would do.
To our top summer associate.
That became a lawyer.
Man, it seemed like a safe move.
You're welcome here at this firm anytime you want.
You're one of us now.
But then I saw it.
A life of backyard grilling and play dates, home improvement projects and overplaying tourist adventures.
Neighbors that probably didn't want to know.
A wife I probably didn't want to know either.
Maybe an affair with my neighbor.
The thing was, whenever I saw people like that.
I always thought, when did you decide to stop trying?
So, I folded that hand.
Yeah.
A year of law school left.
Six figures waiting and I am listening to the fucking army.
What the actual fuck?
Everyone thought I was insane.
I thought I was insane.
The next thing I knew.
I made it through the cue course with special forces selection.
And for the first time in my entire life.
I was happy.
I found something worth doing.
The world where things were doing, they didn't come around here.
I found myself.
I found love.
I found family.
Let's go!
I'm close to all.
I found purpose.
It's our target.
Pleasant and funniest.
We're here to take him out.
He's on the ground.
Nice.
And just like that, my purpose was gone.
I went back to the normal life that I tried to avoid.
I couldn't feel more like a failure.
I thought I'd be a failure.
I couldn't feel more like a failure.
I found myself.
Pleasant.
Pleasant!
Pleasant!
He's gonna be way from school.
It's time to go.
It's time to go!
Good morning.
Yay!
Ew, your breath smells, Daddy.
Oh.
Oh, my teeth.
Okay.
You want a drive?
No!
Okay, yeah, the few years it's all yours, though.
All right, you in everything?
Mason, don't forget her seatbelt.
Like sure to buckle your seatbelt?
Please?
Wave the money, because she'll hate me even more
than she already does if you don't know.
You know how school go?
There's a blue name cheese at all.
There's me all the time.
The twisted kiss means stuff.
What tries to kiss you?
You're nine.
I'm eight, Daddy.
That makes it even worse.
Tell you what, the next time you try to kiss you,
you hit him in the throat.
You want to throw it is?
I'm not an idiot.
Just hit him in the Adam's apple.
All boys have him.
Like penises?
Uh, yes.
Kind, yes.
Just hit him right here, okay?
It'll make it so you can't breathe from him.
Like hitting in the penis.
Yes.
And you know what?
You can do that also.
All right?
Get right here.
Remember your backpack.
Go for it, three-canon.
And don't forget your book bag.
Bye, Daddy.
You have a great day, okay?
Learn things.
Go away.
Go away.
Go away.
Go away.
Go away.
So I told them they can't charge me those calls.
I didn't make those calls.
I didn't even own any of those numbers.
They won't leave me alone, man.
So, um, so you want to hire me to
argue with your phone company for you?
Just my old phone company.
Scott.
You have my word.
I'll make this all go away.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can I give you a retainer?
I'd feel better with a retainer.
Maybe just 500.
Like a star, Scott.
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you.
Yes.
It's so great.
Oh, my gosh.
I'll be in touch, okay?
Thank you.
You don't write, you don't call.
So I live in brief.
It's a best general.
Hey.
Oh, man.
Look at you.
God.
What are you doing here?
I think it's in a suit.
I could ask you the same thing.
Are you kidding?
I'm about to take on a global communications conglomerate.
So, you know what?
You know what?
You know what?
You know what?
You know what?
You know what?
You know what?
A global communications conglomerate.
So, I gotta look the part.
I seem to recall you saying that quitting law
was the best decision you ever made.
I did.
And that becoming a lawyer would only crush your soul.
Yeah, it has.
But I got a wife and a kid,
and they both require income, so.
In lieu of that, I generate broken dreams for all involved.
Well, do you have a half hour to spare for an old friend?
I want to show you something.
I think Lady Justice can wait.
akis
So, what do you think...
Think.
Think you need a lawyer.
You know a good one?
Nope.
Very on, fellas.
Sir.
OK.
C-D-I.
Chicks dig it.
Actually, contract did defense initiatives.
But yes, they do.
You name it, we got it.
And if we don't, we'll find it, buy it, or build it.
We can operate in any environment, in any operational condition.
We are a one-stop shop and shoot.
Ranges, mock villages, our own airstrip.
The whole kit.
I opened up seven years ago.
Yeah, I remember.
But honestly, I never thought you'd pull it off.
Hey.
You don't need, bro.
I started with US governments, then moved to Europe,
then Asia, then South America.
Now we're over 80% corporate contracts.
We're grossing high-eight figures this year.
Private security works always been a bit dicey for me.
It's got thin line between where it started to work, yeah?
No, come on.
It's like any business.
We sell a product.
That product is security.
Came in out there, are you?
Are you a product?
They look the part and they keep the piece.
Can't hire fast enough.
Tons of ex-military, a few cops.
Some good old boys are the passion for the second amendment.
And steroids.
Don't ask, don't tell.
These guys are, uh, potentially, your new colleagues.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Come on.
I'm too broken down.
I'm out of shame.
I'm too old to go run around the world and say,
I got life here.
Hey, son, I know you're miserable.
It's not the point.
Look, the truth is, broken or not, you still look the part.
I'm asking is a personal favor.
I've got an easy personal protection detail.
It's a one-off.
Just help me out, huh?
Total milk run.
You guys don't look like milkmen.
What?
In your right hand, in your palm.
I want you to think about it.
I want you to sleep with it.
I want you to face it.
Wooow!
Take it in your palm, DOG on your head.
Everybody is welcome to Paloña.
It's a beautiful country, oh man.
原er torovenegus,
you kiddin?
He took a job for the guy that killed have 1930.
We were there to kill him in the first place.
Dude, chill.
The job isn't for Venegas.
It's bodywork for a journalist who's gonna interview him.
Just show up be some window dressing for
and make sure she doesn't get groped.
I'm sure our friends died because of that guy.
You don't have to tell me, I know.
And look, if he were to get hit by a bus,
I don't think anybody would be too upset about it.
Believe me, I'd love to do it myself.
But I'm running a business,
and right now that business is getting a journalist
in an out-of-paldonia.
Yeah.
Someone here are the guys.
I can't spare them for this.
Listen, I'm trying to break into the personal protection racket
for journalists, and this is the first step,
so I'm overpaying.
This is me trying to hook you up, okay?
No drama.
Venegas is sending a plane to DC tomorrow to pick you guys up.
Nothing.
20 grand, says you are.
Who's a journalist?
This is recipient of the International Journalism
and Editor's Award, Claire Wellington.
Journalism at its best, it's about the truth.
I share this with all the journalists who report the facts
and who value the truth above all.
In my haste to break a major story,
I neglected to perform my due diligence
in properly fact-checking and thoroughly vetting my sources.
I have resigned.
My position here.
So, uh...
Is everybody doing?
You told your daughter to hit a boy in the throat,
and that boy's father is a lawyer.
A real lawyer.
Whatever this is, it's gone. It's done.
I can't do it anymore, Mason.
Jenny, don't overreact.
I'm not overreacting.
I think it might be best for everybody if you did move out.
I'll never mind. I'll get Casey and I'll go to my mom's.
No.
I'll go.
Hey, Daddy.
Whoa.
What are you doing?
Building a crusher.
Crusher? It's a good finger. You can get it.
Yeah.
Listen, I gotta go out of town for a few days. It's for work.
Do they have snow gloves? Are you going?
Tell you what if they do. I'll get you one.
Thanks, Daddy.
What do you mean you're going out of town for a few days?
It's a good job.
What?
Yeah. It's a bad scenario with me up.
What about your practice?
You just said a minute ago that it wasn't a real lawyer.
What job is this?
Private security? Easy stuff.
Mason, no. That part of your life is over.
You're not going to go and get yourself killed and leave our daughter
without a father to raise her?
Just let me make this money, okay?
You think I don't know how unhappy you are being just a husband and a father?
Imagine what it feels like to be me knowing that I'm the life you settled for.
Cheer me up.
On second thoughts, actually, you should go.
Maybe that's what you need to fix yourself.
Hey.
I want to fix in the workplace and the fallout from that, please.
No, it's great. Of course you're being always about this.
I can't say I'm surprised.
Yeah, I wouldn't want to tarnish your perfect reputation.
You're a saint. You're both ill.
Excuse me, Claire Wellington.
Well, please do, and I'll be sure to badmouth you to anyone who will listen.
That's great. Yes, and you, asshole.
Miss Wellington.
I'm from CDI. I'm Mason Pateats.
You're late. Where's the car?
So, this one.
Great. Can you help me with this?
So, you're my green beret.
I'm a special forces.
Right. A green beret is a hat.
Delta forces in the name of anything but a bad movie.
I'm not my share of your colleagues.
So, where'd you serve?
All the loveliest places has in the Middle East.
South America, of course.
North Carolina.
And that tan line on your ring finger?
You don't know where your wedding ring is when we work.
It could be a possible pressure point if you capture it.
Whether that or you just got a divorce.
So, we're leaving for Paldonia.
You know anything about it?
Sure do.
Paldonia is like a Tim Burton movie.
It's colorful, but it's creepy as fuck.
Is anyone?
I have an exclusive interview with President Juan Arturo Vanegas.
He doesn't do interviews.
Well, I'll do respect you. I understand it all.
I think I understand quite well, but the real question is,
do you understand why you're coming along?
I guess it's not to give my opinion about Juan Arturo Vanegas.
Perfect. Then this will be fine.
I'll focus on Vanegas.
You focus on making sure I don't get robbed or kidnapped at the hotel.
What's up, what's up? Welcome back to infamous Daily Live.
I'm here with Gigi Love,
who went from doing time to being a multi-millionaire entrepreneur
and founder of the Much Love Clothing brand.
Thanks for being here, Gigi.
This is all miles, baby.
Give us a spin, show off what you got.
Wow, I can't wait to get one.
So, tell me.
Have a good lunch.
Was that all on internet search?
Could you trust me? There's far worse out there.
Did you move to the States when you were young?
I noticed you British passport me boarded and you slipped your accent.
Probably moved here as a kid and I've had a guess.
Nobody's asking for your guesses.
My pal Donnie, some sort of image makeover.
This might shock you, Meteor,
but I didn't take a degree at Oxford to cover celebrity bar mitzvahs.
Pal Donnie has some of the largest oil and natural gas fields in the world in Vanegas.
Is the last pure autocrat in the western hemisphere and he doesn't do interviews.
Until now.
Okay.
Just sit here and shut up.
Sounds absolutely brilliant.
Welcome to Palonia.
President Vanegas, so nice to meet you.
Welcome to Palonia.
President Vanegas, so nice to meet you.
Welcome to Palonia.
Welcome to Palonia.
President Vanegas, so nice to meet you.
Ellie sends her regards.
Oh my god, you are even more beautiful in person than on television.
Thank you.
It's like that.
Oh, that was a gift.
What? I have a permit for that.
Before we begin, we must take a selfie.
Oh.
Yes.
Oh.
You approve?
Yes.
Great.
My followers are going to love this.
Use the whole fist.
About that one.
So, Ellie and you were rumored in the university, yes?
Our second and fourth years, yes.
Well, any friends of Velis is welcome in Palonia.
Tell me about her. How was she?
Well, she is very happy in Kansas.
I know. What's in Kansas anyway?
It's a rich rancher she married.
Okay, last time.
Not in Kansas anymore, huh?
Is that joke?
No. The Wizard of Oz.
It's one of my favorite movies.
I should have introduced you, Mason, as my protective detail.
Of course he is. Of course.
Mason Pateed's.
CDI's finest.
Former Armist Special Forces, right?
Mazzone Pateed.
The Little House.
We do our own research, too.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Come on, let's go.
I don't like it, you know me.
You can do whatever you want.
Would you like to read my study?
No, no, thanks.
President Venegas, I really appreciate you giving me this kind of access.
Of course.
It's like they say, a blind pig has used its nose.
There are so many wonderful things about my country.
I can't wait for you to share them with the world.
Look, me hint, my people.
There's a bright future ahead of us.
Bright future.
The freedom of speech is very present in Paldania.
Let's move on.
Just confirming we are still headed to your ranch, right?
I am taking you to my country estate.
I think we're going to love it.
Let's toast.
Okay.
One for you.
One for me.
And we toast for your safe travels.
For your friends.
I like it.
Arriva.
Au revoir.
A centro.
Okay.
If you don't mind, Mr. President, I'd love to go over a few my interview questions with you now.
Yes, of course.
Don't prepare yourself.
Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.
I love it.
I'm going to be ready to fail.
Nice.
We're going to kill.
We're going to kill.
We're going to kill.
We're going to kill.
Where is the bomb?
Where is the bomb?

Sorry, go ahead.
Nazim.

Bravo, bravo, my little swan.
Papa, move back to hand, baby.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Wait, wait, Nazim.
I can't, I can't.
I can't.
Oh.
I guess we're taking a break.
No.
Are you okay?
He's winning, too?
I'm good.
So, who's trying to kill us?
Nobody.
Nobody is trying to kill us to try to kill him.
I don't want to be late.
Well, you know what they say.
Only an insect can end up with a country.
Who wants to be late today?
I don't know.
Oh, you have a phone.
Who are you going to call?
Help.
Earl.
Yo, it's Mason. We got hit.
Shit. What happened? You okay, Mason?
Now, heading out of town. They took out our vehicles.
I got us out safe, but I...
Bro, we're stuck. I got no idea where we're at.
Is Wellington safe?
Yeah, she's with me.
Vanegas is here, too.
What? Why is he with you? What about his team?
Dead. Bro, you got to get us a ride.
Hang tight.
GPS has your position.
There's a clearing...
three-clicks east.
X filled there by Hilo.
I'm going to call some colleagues in the area. I'll get you picked up.
So much for a milk run.
May I use your phone?
Nope. But I need to make a call.
Yeah. I don't care.
Mason.
What? Tell me why you should do a favor for him.
Well, for example, because I can have you arrested for being a foreign spy.
Maybe I pull a coup in my own, then.
Stop it, Mason.
Have you ever seen Mason?
Once you've seen Mason, you've never seen him.
Whenever he's gone, you've never seen him.
He's singing. Titratos don't get the same.
Really? Well then, go ahead.
You admit Mr. Pettit, I am not a friend of death.
And I'm not a friend of people like you.
To it.
Have you ever heard me?
Hey, Haiman, officer.
The gun down. Please.
How can we get together?
Yes, yes.
Thank you so far.
Thank you.
Don't worry.
I'll make a petite.
I'll make a betit.
Mr.
Do you hear me?
I don't know.
The light is the same.
The light is perfect, F.
Thank you, General.
Hello.
Jorge.
Sobrino.
Tio.
Of course.
How are you doing here with the selva?
How are you?
I'm fine.
How are you, man?
I'm fantastic.
I'm doing the selva with an absolutely precious woman.
The gringa journalist.
Yes, of course.
The journalist, Claire Wellington.
Oh, no.
It's precious.
It's amazing, it's intelligent.
Is he asking what I'm wearing?
No, he's describing what you're wearing.
Oh, Yuga?
Don't look at me as your friend of a friend.
Yeah, I just didn't realize he and Ellie kept in touch still.
What?
The interview.
It's obviously why he invited me here.
He invited you?
Why?
Because I'm not just a celebrity news reporter to you now.
No.
I thought you landed the interview.
Everybody's asked him for an interview.
Everybody's asked him for an interview.
But Aldonia's been basically a media blackout for the last decade.
Then just like that, he emailed me and asked me if I wanted an interview.
Why do you think you're here?
I'm not totally clueless.
Yes, yes, I'm sorry, we're not ready.
Well, here we were all very worried about you.
Of course.
Well, let me tell you something.
I'm not dead.
Our partners are going to be very comfortable.
Thank you.
Please tell us you have good news.
Oh, I have wonderful news.
I was just talking to Jorge, my nephew.
He's the one behind the coup.
That's good news?
Yes, he's great news.
You see, I love my nephew.
But he's an idiot.
So he just told you?
No, he didn't tell me anything, but he said everything.
He will not move a finger if he knows that I am still alive.
So I told him that everything was okay and that we were going to go to see him.
You see?
You must always stroke the head that you are going to cut off.
So is he working with the rebels?
No, no, no, no.
The rebels also think that he's an idiot.
Let's go.
Back to the capital.
No.
No.
Do what you want.
We're not here.
We can't just leave him.
Just did.
I need to report this.
We can't just let another government in another poor country get overthrown in another coup and nobody pays attention.
Come on, don't let Vinega suck you and use the textbook sociopath.
He seems okay.
Please, read him, Arant.
I have.
I'm well aware of what the world expects from Claire Wellington at the moment.
But I have sacrificed everything for my career.
My family, relationships, my life.
So forgive me if I refuse to be the laughing stock who went from winning a Peabody to covering celebrity mancapes.
This is my chance.
It's working out better than I ever could have hoped.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
Never could have hoped.
And it's the only way you're looking at it.
THEY H 하겠습니다.
Calm down.
That's the best one.
Maize and Rotjen's, we are going to call from the bus at CDI,
or Gina into their left.
Yeah, we sure do.
Got an EDI of two minutes for you.
Yeah, we're headed towards a clearing right now.
You got my GPS?
We got a heading strike for it.
We can't get here fast enough.
We'll be standing by it.
OK, it's the site.
We're getting picked up in a few minutes.
Are you sure we can't say?
Oh, I'm sure.
Be chill.
Picked up across the border.
You'll find a Starbucks with free Wi-Fi.
Some break your story from there.
Sure, sure.
I can't get a P body if you're dead.
What about the negas?
Do you think he'll be OK?
I don't give a shit about the negas.
What is your deal with him?
It's smell of the free Wi-Fi now.
Not good.
What?
What?
No!
No!
Oh, no.
No.
Just like that.
Come on.
Who killed me?
You've embraced the sock.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I'm still excited to cover a crew.
Less and less, honestly.
Yes.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Shit, he's gone for another round.
Stay put.
Shit.
Come, you got that!
One!
One!
Mason?
Mason?
Mason?
Mason?
Mason?
Oh, not Mason.
Oh, not Mason.
This area is such good idea.
Are you okay?
I'm afraid.
Did you help?
Are you okay?
Did you help?
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
You good?
Suddenly, I'm very glad I paid you to tag along.
Mason?
Where is Veneras?
I'm here.
I'm so sorry for the mess that I have made.
Thank you.
Where did you come from?
From behind that tree.
Not literally.
It's up the hand cannon.
What kind of a guy would you take if he didn't have a pick on?
One second.
That's Mr. Pettis.
Come on, Pettis.
We have to get out of here.
Wait.
Come on.
Come on.
Colonel, call host.
You need a rescue.
My clients are very disappointed that your uncle is still alive and causing trouble.
It would appear that your men likewise failed to kill my uncle.
Certainly, our arrangements of the shaky start.
My clients need assurance that their investment in your country remains secure.
Is that clear?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
Better one man dies instead of a thousand.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, this is just awesome.
Yeah.
So how'd you get wounded?
You're back.
Saw you been favoring it.
I'm sorry for trying to have a human moment with you in the middle of a jungle where we could die at any second.
Mission I was on one side was a woman.
I got injured, my back hurts.
So that happened here?
Yeah.
It's my last mission.
And so you're married?
Or were married?
I didn't quite follow a good ring thing.
Yes.
Probably separated by now.
I was just way better at being an operator than I am in normal day to day life.
I got hurt when I got out.
I just sucked.
I got it below.
To make years to figure it out would become a lawyer.
Wait, you're a lawyer?
Yeah.
Officially you passed the bar, hold on.
Thought it would make me feel more normal.
Turns out it just made me hate myself.
So you got into private security?
Yeah.
How long you been doing that now?
Five, four, three days.
What?
CDI said you were their best.
You saw me take out the helicopter.
I think you got your money as well, right?
Come on, else.
It was pretty cool.
It was pretty damn cool.
We should go around.
How rude would that be?
It probably isn't safe.
It's very safe.
Welcome to Sabrin, my home.
What's wrong, Peter?
You're not a kid!
You're not a kid, are you?
No, no.
You're not a kid, are you?
Claire Mason, this is my oldest friend.
Nestos and the Val.
He is the leader of this village.
It's an honor.
What do you say?
That's some funny, I guess.
This is Pepino.
He's the son-in-law of the chief.
He will give us a ride into town tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Yes, Mason.
Nobody travels in this region of the country at night.
Not even mercenaries.
Consider the chance to rest and wash off the blood.
Cool.
It's okay.
Do you want to see him?
I don't want to see him.
I don't want to see him.
I don't want to see him.
Nobody travels in this region of the country at night.
Not even mercenaries.
Consider the chance to rest and wash off the blood.
How cool?
It's okay.
Do you want to see him?
What?
Oh, my God.
I didn't tell you anything.
Oh.
Nice, incoherent.
Oh.
Call on me and press Mr. Pettit.
What Pettit is all about?
Oh, my God.
I didn't tell you anything.
Oh.
Nice, incoherent.
Oh.
Call on me and press Mr. Pettit.
What Pettit is all about?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Is that all?
Shall we do the interview?
Huh?
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
So what do you want me to do again?
Just a standard two shot.
Didn't exactly better than that basic train.
Just a standard two shot.
Didn't exactly better than that basic train.
Just to make sure we're both in the frame.
Shall we begin?
Please.
Okay, we'll just...
Are we rolling?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
President Phinegas, thank you for speaking to me
about the events that have transpired over the past 12 hours.
I truly appreciate the opportunity of speaking with you.
The world will soon learn that earlier this morning you've survived an assassination attempt
that resulted in the deaths of your entire security team.
Sadly, yes.
Who do you think is behind this attempted coup?
Our land and its mineral resources have been exploited by outsiders for a very long time.
And there is no secret that these outsiders have propped up my presidency for many years
while I turn my back on my people.
The CIA, the SIS, there are only a tool to influence leaders like me and countries like mine.
But the real power has always been the hands of CEOs and shareholders
that make billions out of our natural resources in the back of my people.
So the corporations were behind the attempt on your life?
I was with you. The attackers seemed like professional soldiers.
What can these people by-clar?
You think an assassination attempt is carried?
Try telling the CEO of a global energy company to go fuck his mother
and watch your currency drop 70% by the end of the conference call.
But Paldonia has been blessed with a second chance.
In my fist, our land and its rare earth metals
that are the core component from every new technology.
Cell phones, tablets, electric cars, MRI machines.
These corporations they want to exploit our new resource by a pittance of what is worth.
And I have told them that I will not allow it.
Which is why they're trying to kill me.
Paldonia will become the number one provider of the world's most precious metal.
Di promesa y miligado.
La riqueza que se obtenga de estos metales
será invertida única y exclusivamente para enriquecer al pueblo de Paldonia.
Que viva Paldonia!
How would you say that?
Quite above, Christian garo here.
Here you come, here you come, there, there, there.
Back down, take it down!
Come on, here get pretty and ready to giving up.
I'm telling you something, you stay in my life, very impressive.
I'm telling you something, you stay in my life, very impressive.
I'm telling you something, you stay in my life, very impressive.
I'm telling you something, you stay in my life, very impressive.
I'm telling you something, you stay in my life, very impressive.
I'm telling you something, you stay in my life, very impressive.
You don't have to sleep in a chair, Mason.
I slept in worse.
Wanna play a game to see who gets the bed?
Okay.
If you know what this is, I'm gonna be in trouble.
That's a Mandela.
I'm guessing you got any idea.
Work trip.
Okay.
Okay.
This is Latin.
She flies with her own wings.
That's Latin that, um, it's cool.
Yeah, I got it a few years ago.
It's a reminder that everything's gonna work out fine.
And, uh, what would you need that reminder?
Aside from being here with an experienced bodyguard and being hunted by mercenaries?
Stop.
Um, can you see that?
Yep, uh, Anarchy.
What do you not believe in any form of government?
I didn't when I was a teenager.
I was very rebellious.
I can buy that.
It got me into journalism, you know, confronting power, fighting governments to get to the truth.
It's not to love.
Yeah, yeah.
So whatever you thought, I came here for the chance to confront a dictator and hold power to account.
That's why I came here, not for my career.
Maybe a little bit for my career.
And you tell me something.
Good night.
Are you enjoying this?
I'm just doing my job.
Yeah, me too.
I can't, I can't.
You still love her?
Yeah.
Timing, right?
Yeah, the worst.
Good night, Mr. Pateats.
Good night, Miss Wanton.
Mm.
Morning.
You.
We gotta go.
You're still not gonna let me go to Porto Santiago to tell this story, huh?
That's a negative.
You got your exclusive.
We get you the safety.
You break your story.
Do you think I have enough of a story?
I mean, yes, I have the negas telling his side, but it can still be dismissed as the rantings of a dictator trying to explain away a popular revolt.
That is true.
The world has always been large, yapathetic towards my country.
That has served many well, but not my people.
That is why today I am going to Porto Santiago for the future of my people.
Very inspiring.
I'm just gonna move to the delusions of saving your people with the back burner and not getting us killed to the front burner.
Why are you here, Mason?
What?
Yes.
Why are you here in Porto Santiago?
Talk to her.
Really?
That's why you think you're here?
For such a cynical man, you are hopelessly naive, Mason.
Out of all places, you are sent here.
The question is why, Mason?
Come on.
Yeah, it's Mason.
Mason, are you okay? I'm freaking out here.
Yeah.
What's the story, bro?
You sent me down here because you don't have a role over.
Maybe I was too big of a mess to handle it, because I like to own a bunch of these dudes.
What are you talking about?
Come on, man.
You really gonna try to convince me you sent me down here and ran him and then meet the guy who killed half of our friends.
And then the day I get here by coincidence, it's a coup with a bunch of South Africans.
It should be great.
Hey, it's not what you think.
All right, just breathe.
I love you like a brother.
Yeah.
I'm right there.
I can't figure out why you needed me down here.
They wanted you to dispose of him.
Kill the niggas?
At his ranch.
One of his bodyguards was gonna get you a gun, sneak you into his bedroom.
Yeah, but why me?
I thought it'd be a gift.
Take out the guy who killed our brothers.
But apparently his nephew thought the niggas was hip to it and he jumped the gun.
I never would have sent you down there if I thought there was gonna be a coup.
Said, what kind of insanity you got yourself into?
Look, security contracting.
You deal with some shady people.
Some of it rubs off on you.
Who are these people who paid you?
The South Africans are contractors, too.
They approach me when the Wellington interview happened.
They rent people who want to take control of the...
We have the night.
Right.
Mace, there's an easy fix here.
Put a bullet in Venegas.
Do it for the guys we lost.
Do it for his country.
Do it for the world.
Mace.
Mace.
Hello?
Honey?
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, uh...
Hey, I, um...
I just wanted to tell you that I love you and Mommy so much.
I love you too, Daddy.
Daddy, Mommy is sad.
You should come home.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I promise I'll be home soon.
Hey, is Mommy there?
Can you come home?
Yeah.
I'll be home soon.
I'll be home soon.
I'll be home soon.
Yeah.
I'll be home soon.
Hey, is, is Mommy there?
Can you put Mommy on the phone right now?
Okay.
But she told Grandma that she just want to talk to you again
until you get your shit together.
Just put Mommy on the phone, sweetheart.
Mommy!
Daddy's on the phone.
Okay, honey.
You go get ready.
Okay.
Mason?
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm just in a shop getting cases on them.
Listen.
I just wanted to say thank you.
You're sticking with me through all this,
and then I love you very much.
Oh.
Okay.
I mean, you're kind of scaring me with that.
No, no.
It's a door.
Don't worry.
I love you.
I love you too.
So much.
Please just come home.
In one piece.
I'm on my way.
Okay.
I got her.
Check it out.
Shit, what did you walk to this?
I saw you go to the position, right?
You walk to the position, like, right here.
And then you go like,
Your leg.
Raise your hand.
Hey.
We're heading for the border tonight.
What?
We're leaving.
That's that.
Don't know, wait.
Don't give me a reason.
Where's Vinegas?
Vinegas!
Vinegas!
Dude, stop following us already.
I could say the same thing to you, but I have much better matters.
My amigo has a car.
Come on.
Where is the president of Vinegas?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
Vinegas!
What do we give him?
I tell you, where are the president of Vinegas?
I'm not sure.
Where are the president of Vinegas?
Darn!
Sit!
me!
My man's over here.
This is true, Carl.
What?
This is in your...
Doesn't look very fast.
We're gonna do with this thing.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Wait, wait!
Ah, ah, there we go.
It's only made out of this.
If they kill him here, they kill every person in this village.
Oh, no!
I hate you.
Hey!
You're looking for Benegas?
He is Benegas!
Um...
Can you ride?
I'm gonna reach.
Huh?
Huh?
Okay.
Oh!
Oh!
Come on, come on.
Um...
Oh!
Get on!
What?
Get on!
No, no!
I have Benegas horses!
Half of your pitches are on horses!
He's fun to show!
Let's go!
Oh!
Okay!
Oh, come on!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, no!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Hold on, my legs!
Oh!
Oh!
This isn't weird, though.
Let's go!
Let's go now!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Hang tight!
Where?
Where?
This way!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Oh!
Help!
Help!
Help!
No!
Where?
Follow me!
Oh!
Oh!
Hang on!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
He's behind her!
He's behind her!
Oh!
Where?
Get her, shoot him up!
Shoot him up!
He's on the back!
What's next, though?
Love is burning, too.
Mark, all you clear.
Push through.
Oh, she was right behind us.
Oh!
Oh!
No.
Don't worry.
They won't hurt her if I'm still alive.
It's like I'm going to pour to a Santiago.
Excellent!
What?
Oh!
Oh!
So you take money to make private wars?
What's that like?
Why don't you ask your green beret?
What?
But I seem to have been kidnapped by mercenaries.
Sweetheart, we just saved you from the worst dictate
of this continent has ever seen.
I guess I missed the chivalry
while you were shooting at me.
You were shooting at him?
Our group has been contracted on behalf
of the people of Belgrade.
I mean, a corporate-backed coup of a sovereign nation?
You know, most journalists, schools, chaos, and friends.
They have no idea what's actually going on.
We are here to bring stability and peace
to a complicated situation.
You really think that your reporting can change
the will of the powerful.
This might sound crazy, but yes, I do.
I'm kind of part of the gig.
It certainly sounds nice, and I wish you were right, Claire.
I really do.
Unfortunately, people are foolish.
People just want honesty.
I don't know what they want.
I can't see what matters.
I need looking off, then.
So what matters?
What matters is power.
You can all that can use it.
And who's using you?
Well, Claire.
Certainly people who don't like what you do.
They don't give a red sauce of jealousy.
How much further?
We're almost there.
It's just over the reach.
What's with the singing, eh?
You're nervous.
Well, I believe that when one encounters danger,
you should sing to it.
You kept it right?
How much of a singer?
How much of a dancer is it?
You're not afraid of a big belly laugh every now and again, huh?
Of course.
You're not afraid of a big belly laugh every now and again, huh?
Of course.
You're not afraid of a big belly laugh every now and again, huh?
Of course.
I believe that one should always remember to laugh.
Well, I found out why I'm here.
Oh.
They wanted me to kill you.
That makes sense.
It does?
Of course.
You blame me for shooting down your helicopter,
for your friends dying, for your life ever since.
Then my late bodyguard Manuel gives you a gun
and lets you into my bedroom.
Wait, you knew about that?
I don't stay in power by not knowing things, Mason.
I'd be so bad at being addicted.
No, you'd be great at it.
It's just practice.
There's something important I need to tell you, though.
I didn't shoot down your helicopter.
Come on, man.
I know you didn't personally.
It was friendly fire.
Do you really think we can stop an American invasion
by shooting down one helicopter?
I mean, of course, I knew you guys were coming,
but there is nothing I could do to stop you.
So as a matter of fact, I was getting ready to take a boat to Cuba.
Suddenly, a helicopter gets shut down and everything stops.
Just like that.
In the next morning, I get a visit from one of my ex-patrons,
telling me that the next time the helicopter would land.
Unless I signed off some new oil leases,
which, of course, I did.
Your ponds.
I'm very sorry about your friends, Mason.
It's crazy how all this is going down.
I do agree to your first interview ten years.
Ah, that's why you need to clear.
You're going to tell the truth before they could take you on
and replace you with somebody more user-friendly.
We'll stop here for the night.
And then we end the charade.
I'm sorry.
Brother, you are killing me right now.
I'm worried sick about you. Are you still with Venegas?
Yeah.
I cut ties with the South Africans.
I'm going to make this go away.
Dude, we need to talk.
Good ass.
Good ass.
Thanks.
So I agreed to trade you for Claire.
Of course you did.
Yeah, it's a move I haven't totally thought through.
May I please use your phone?
For what?
I'm going to call someone I trust.
Is he the one who I love?
Who's that?
He's an old friend.
And the shadow leader of the opposition party too?
He's a very resourceful.
Amazing, please.
Will you sit down and enjoy a cup of espresso with me?
It's the best one in Padonia, huh?
This is a stupid idea.
Gracias, amor.
What is that saying?
Keep your friends close.
Keep your enemies closer.
That's from the gun.
It's from the gun, brother.
America does produce some wonderful culture.
What if you agree?
Bobbi.
Oh no.
Bobbi.
Bobbi.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I don't know.
I'm not.
I'm not.
Bobbi.
Bobbi.
No.
No.
That's me, what happened?
No.
Don't make me feel happy.
I know, I know.
But it's okay.
You still get this?
This is my new American friend, Mason Petit.
And he's very worried about you.
An American friend?
You really have hate bottom.
Sit down.
Did you know we went to secondary school together?
Yes, it's.
Yes, it's.
And I could tell you something?
They did not let us get away with anything.
Now.
It's delicious.
So, do tell.
What can the people's worker party?
And, or the armed revolutionary front of Paldonia?
Do for you today.
Just a Petit favor, my friend.
So, um...
I gotta ask.
Why have this wrestler with a man who calls me a thief
and a butcher on a daily basis?
And every so often lights off a bomb down town?
Yeah.
Well, it perception is reality, my friend.
I pay love out to his resistance.
Every couple of months, I let them blow up a car,
burned down a building, spayed in my caravan.
It's like...
It's like a steam valve.
You know?
Let's off-pression.
Ssss...
Man, I cranked you out on them so everybody knows
they need the necast to keep order!
Huh?
My gran uncle...
Your gran uncle, you overthrew.
Yes, that one.
He never understood this.
Took everything personally.
Of course, it backed fire on him.
So you bought the revolution?
What's simpler, and a lot cheaper.
It's like you Americans like to say.
A win-win.
You should see Eduardo Spul.
Oh.
Come on.
Oh.
Oh.
Follow us.
Colonel Colhorst, former South African S.A.S.
Three-two battalion.
You have all my special forces.
Me?
Come and lawyer.
Sorry.
I want a business card.
Pretty brazen thing you're doing here
taking over a sovereign nation.
Sovereign?
And all said in them,
no one's going to have a problem
with what we're on here.
The people of Paladonia, might.
They weren't in the difference.
State is squawed, my friend.
You should have done what was expected,
Sergeant Petits.
No.
I never got near him.
You see, Venegas knew it was going down.
You'd be surprised what that guy knows, actually.
Sharp dude, great dresser.
What are we doing this then?
Let's do it.
Bring your princess Eric correct.
Don't view the handover of the Negis
and piss off out of the country.
If you don't do that in five seconds,
I'm going to clear your client in front of you.
One,
two,
three,
four.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Go, go, go!
What was that?
That was my people clear.
Huh?
Now?
I give my people a message and you share it with the world.
Great, let's get started.
I can lie, feed it through him from a stale.
No, no, no, no.
I cannot deliver such an important message from here.
We have to do it from my palace with my nephew by my side.
Come on, what do we just go up and knock on the front door?
No.
There is another way.
Watch your head there.
Okay?
This is the time I used to escape when they tried to kill me eight years ago.
Sure, this time I was in guarded.
Absolutely.
All the people who know about it are dead now.
What about people in terms of trying to kill you?
Oh, it's different, dead people.
Let's go.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh no!
It's okay.
This is my American friends, they're here to help.
What does this woman do?
I'm live streaming this to the entire world.
I do not know.
Oh no!
Oh, thank you.
What's that?
Oh, thank you.
Don't worry about Timan.
It's okay.
These are my American friends.
They are here to help.
What is this woman doing?
I'm live streaming this to the entire world.
Listen to me, when you are no longer useful to them,
they are going to kill you.
Pandonia deserves a better future,
not one controlled by corporations.
We...
we don't have to be monsters anymore.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No, no.
No, no.
Let's go.
No, no.
You deserve the Martins.
The president.
David and Collian.
That's what I see.
Are you good?
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Luke.
Luke.
I wouldn't prove so to...
For a methodology.
I should have a mate for you.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I did it.
I did it.
I did it.
I did it.
So let's go, let's go, let's go.
Sorry.
Everything I made...
Shhh, Shhh
Shh
Shh
Shhh
Sevente!
Le dance.
Sollado ¡uesta!
Yo sé qué parroves terminé aся en órdenes.
Mis hijos... no tienen por qué hacer esto.
Les hermanos, ustedes pueden cambiar el destino de este país.
For me, for me, for you, for your mothers, for your parents, for your children.
Our country takes a lot of time, bloodshed.
We have to end with this madness.
No, sir.
It's time to fight.
Fight for this land.
My brothers defend their homeland.
No!
No!
Don't fight for Donia!
Hey, now's the time for Gucci.
Fuck, man!
Go! Go for it, but don't know!
Hey! Now it's the time for coaching!
Fuck, man!
Get out of here!
Spill them! What the hell you do with?
Let's stand out!
Take the coming, okay? Hold on, hold on!
Ready? Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Follow me! Follow me!
Come on!
You've been hit!
I'm fine! Come on!
See?
Fine!
Come here, we're staying here. This is my mine cave.
You killed my drink?
Yeah, I always love a single malt after I need to cap a few mercenaries.
Come on Mason, brace the suck.
Oh, oh!
Yes!
This way, come on!
Mr. Vemegas?
The president?
Yes!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
That way! That way we have to go! That way!
Go!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Down!
Let's go! Let's go!
Ready?
Let's go!
Say it or two makes for me.
Shame it took so long to finish the job.
It's you.
You killed my friends.
It was several of us.
All P.G. is on Tadeesi to Amy.
It's just a job, my friend.
Hey.
Where'd you learn that?
Throat thing?
Think we're dead for that.
I told you I could help.
Mason!
I can really use your help right now.
Oh, my God.
Mason!
I can really use your help right now.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
What?
No, it keeps you playing.
Come on!
Hey, bro!
Ah-ha! Chick's digging!
Huh?
It's an exciting joke.
Come on!
Yes, sir!
Try my friend.
Give me!
Never thought I'd say this, but...
I'd like to introduce you to President Benegas.
Welcome to Palvania.
In Contado de Concentre!
Creole!
The eyes of the world are still fixed on Paldonia,
where the fallout from a failed coup continues to play out.
In a bold act of guerrilla journalism,
using a live stream through gossip site infamously,
celebrity reporter Claire Wellington
provided on the ground coverage of these shocking events.
The Paldonia military were seen in an intense battle
with members of what we now know
to be a private military company.
Ms. Wellington has also uploaded an exclusive uncut interview
with President Benegas, announcing a surprising reversal
in the Paldonian system of government.
I know it was a journalist, I'm supposed to stay objective and all,
but I have to say, I really admire what you're doing.
Well, you know what they say.
The man who touches honey will eventually...
lick his fingers.
I really appreciate you, too.
I really do.
And look, the world is finally seeing us,
and it is all because of you, Ms. Wellington.
Looks like your tattoo is right.
Everything worked out just fine.
It worked out fine, thanks to you.
Team effort.
Yes, they're right people at the right time.
Yeah.
Let's go tell a story to the world.
I want to follow your lead.
Hold up just one second, just so I know.
How many people in this room want to kill you right now?
Probably half.
No, more than half.
Let's go.
Welcome.
As of today,
I am no longer the president of Paldonia.
A transitional government has been put in place until the next three elections.
During this transitional period,
five billion dollars would be invested in health, education,
and infrastructure.
This is an investment in the people of Paldonia.
They get back what is right for years.
For the years to come,
we will protect and control these resources
with the sole purpose
of giving this beautiful nation.
Jay, like that.
Dancing with them.
Here's another one.
Daddy!
Daddy!
And check this out.
One's your base.
It's a long story.
Oh, baby.
Here I am.
In one piece,
just so you know that
broken man he wanted before,
so he disappeared somewhere in South America.
I was really hoping you'd reconsider.
Wow, you know what?
I think I'm gonna have to consult my lawyer.
Oh, Mason.
No.
I said I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna stop.
Shit.
Shit.
Yes!
And just like that,
I saw an incredible life of many vans,
play dates and amusement parks.
For the first time in my entire overachieving life,
I was happy.
What's up?
What do you say?
Just take the rest of the day off and spend it with the family.
Oh, yeah!
You like that?
Yeah, you're so cute.
What?
Well,
the head purpose.
He says he does it.
And then we came out and he was like,
just dick stare.
And it was like weird,
because you know, you only have two seconds.
Well, because it's five times.
It's impressive to stare at a guy's dick.
He's like, I'm telling you.
He's a snake, he's a monster.
Eight Mississippi.
